#Swasthya Sahayak

###About:
Swasthya Sahayak is an application to keep record of healthcare related documents at one place.

We have a web and an mobile platform to reach out to as many users as possible.

The web portal can be used for both patients and doctors(hospital, clinics, laboratories etc).

Hospitals and Clinics can upload data/reports of a particular patient in the database. This way we can keep the medical
history of a patient which can be very useful in many situations.

Users/Patients can see their data using the mobile app as well as web portal.

The data is stored in a centralized database.
